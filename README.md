## 👋 Hello!

I’m a **Junior Front-End Developer**, just about to graduate a Fullstack Developer bootcamp.

I have been learning programming since May 2023. While participating 11-month Full Stack Developer Kodilla bootcamp, I created many projects using JavaSript, React and NodeJS.

One of them was a group project led by PM in the Kanban methodology, covering almost all aspects of commercial programming. [This one](https://github.com/odevpl/wdp-2310).

I am currently working on the final project – an e-commerce website using my own brand and products, [check how the code is growing](https://github.com/Ola-Cencora/Fullstack_e-commerce).

### Why do I want to become a developer? 👀

I have always been interested in **technology and science**, especially how quickly our world is developing. So you see, I had to try.

**I tried it and I really liked it!**

The more I learn, the more fascinating everything becomes. I am still amazed by the endless possibilities that programming offers and how much technology influences every day of our lives!

#### 🤔 Wait, front-end or full-stack?
I really enjoy creating aesthetic and functional web solutions.  And I also like to "know things”, that’s why I decided on full-stack bootcamp, because I wanted to not only be able to create something that looks good but is also fully functional. Learning backend technologies allowed me to better understand how everything works together.

#### 🎀 Aesthetic, huh?
Yup, I happen to know something about this, because I ran my own ceramics studio for several years. [Here you can see more 🍭](https://github.com/Ola-Cencora/KURZceramika-web-project)
