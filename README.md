## üëã Hello!

I‚Äôm a **Junior Front-End Developer**, looking for my first commercial experience.

I have been learning programming since May 2023. While participating 11-month Full Stack Developer Kodilla bootcamp, I created many projects using JavaSript, React and NodeJS. You can see my final project [here](https://github.com/Ola-Cencora/Fullstack_e-commerce).

I am currently working on improving my testing skills by taking part in **React Testing Library and Jest** course by Stephen Grider.

### Why do I want to become a developer? üëÄ

I have always been interested in **technology and science**, especially how quickly our world is developing. So you see, I had to try.

**I tried it and I really liked it!**

The more I learn, the more fascinating everything becomes. I am still amazed by the endless possibilities that programming offers and how much technology influences every day of our lives!

#### ü§î Wait, front-end or full-stack?
I really enjoy creating aesthetic and functional web solutions.  And I also like to "know things‚Äù, that‚Äôs why I decided on full-stack bootcamp, because I wanted to not only be able to create something that looks good but is also fully functional. Learning backend technologies allowed me to better understand how everything works together.

#### üéÄ Aesthetic, huh?
Yup, I happen to know something about this, because I ran my own ceramics studio for several years. [Here you can see more üç≠](https://github.com/Ola-Cencora/KURZceramika-web-project)
